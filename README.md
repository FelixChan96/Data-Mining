# Data Mining Sample Work 

Please read the description below before checking out the report PDFs as well as the Python scripts.

**Description of tasks**

This will feature decision trees, random forests and ensemble learning. 
Applying the CART (classification and regression tree) for the sample problem (predicting the age of abalone) and report classification performance on the train and test set using the same train/test split. 
1. Report the Tree Visualisation 
2. Investigate the improvement to performance by further pruning the tree. 
3. Apply Blagging of Trees via Random Forests and show performance as number of trees in the ensembles increases. Carry out 10 experiments in Part 1 and 3 and show performance with mean and confidence interval.
